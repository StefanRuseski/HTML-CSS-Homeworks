    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        The simbiosis with these beautiful creatures makes us different and more fulfilled, and it makes us happier
        because we have an opportunity to participate in the creation of something beautiful and perfect as Doberman. We
        live for a day when every new litter which we created will be bread, hoping that we shall achieve to create an
        even better litter from the one that came before and we shall further improve the breed. Even after so many
        years we still have many sleepless nights because we contemplate another combination in the future. It is nice
        to live daily with sweet uncertainty while watching how the beautiful small creatures grow into the fulfillment
        of your dreams every day.

        Altobello is a family. Altobello is friendship. Doberman is a million violins, the sky above us.
        Altobello Doberman is a living dream.</p>
